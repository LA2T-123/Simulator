# Bitcoin Mining Simulator

A web-based interactive Bitcoin mining simulator that helps users understand how cryptocurrency mining works. This educational tool simulates the process of Bitcoin mining, including concepts like hash rate, difficulty, power consumption, and profitability.

## Features

- **Interactive Mining Simulation**: Start and stop mining with real-time hash generation
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Modify mining difficulty, hash rate, and power consumption
- **Economic Analysis**: Calculate profitability based on electricity costs and current Bitcoin price
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated mining rig and real-time hash display
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitor session time, blocks mined, and total hashes calculated
- **Profit/Loss Chart**: Visual representation of mining economics over time

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid layouts)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts for typography

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Adjust the mining parameters using the sliders:
   - Mining Difficulty: How hard it is to find a valid hash
   - Hash Rate: How many hashes per second your virtual miner can calculate
   - Power Consumption: How much electricity your virtual mining rig uses
   - Electricity Cost: The cost per kilowatt-hour in your area
3. Click "Start Mining" to begin the simulation
4. Watch as the simulator attempts to find valid hashes
5. Monitor your statistics and profitability in real-time
6. Click "Stop Mining" to pause the simulation

## Educational Value

This simulator helps users understand:

- The computational process behind Bitcoin mining
- The concept of proof-of-work and mining difficulty
- The economic factors affecting mining profitability
- The relationship between hash rate, power consumption, and mining success
- The impact of electricity costs on mining operations

## Disclaimer

This is an educational simulation only. It does not perform actual cryptocurrency mining and does not generate real Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The economic calculations are simplified for educational purposes and may not reflect the exact economics of real-world mining operations.
